# Week 4 Side Quest: JSON Level Generation

## Group Members
[Your Name], [WatID], [Student Number]

## Description
This is a simple grid-based maze game that demonstrates dynamic level generation using JSON data and arrays. The player navigates through multiple levels by moving with arrow keys to reach the green goal tile. 

The game uses nested loops to dynamically place tiles (walls, floors, and goals) based on data loaded from a JSON file. Each level has different dimensions and layouts, demonstrating the flexibility of JSON-driven level design.

**Bonus feature implemented:** The game automatically loads the next level when the player reaches the goal tile, creating a continuous gameplay experience across all three levels.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

### Running the Game:
1. Open `index.html` in Google Chrome (or access via GitHub Pages)

### Controls:
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the player (blue circle) up, down, left, and right
- **Goal**: Reach the green tile to advance to the next level

### Gameplay:
